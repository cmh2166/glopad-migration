## GloPAD - retirement planning

* updated - jgr25@cornell.edu - 8/5/2016

### Summary
GloPAD is a grant funded web application written by CUL 2002-2009. The application has a lot of web security problems. Library Systems has applied mod_security as a temporary blanket fix for the issues. This breaks a lot of the application's functions. The problem at hand is how to maintain availability the information in the site, while avoiding the security issues.

### Scope

* This is not intended as a proposal, just a document describing the current state of GloPAD (as of Aug 2016).
* Work in progress, not complete
* I will try to keep the detailed information in separate documents
